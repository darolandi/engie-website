NSCC Engineering Club
======================

The Engineering Club at North Seattle Community College. <br />
Every year, we hold a Mentor Night where various professionals are invited to share their experience with NSCC students. <br/>
At other times, we sometimes organize student tour to interesting places, such as Sound Transit Tunnel, Fremont Bridge, and Brightwater Treatment Center.
