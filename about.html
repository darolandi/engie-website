				<h3>About NSCC Engineering Club</h3>
				<p>The Engineering Club is what our members make it. This year it has primarily been about meeting professionals (mentoring) and getting out to see real engineering projects (tours). We've also provided a bridge between 1st year and 2nd year students.</p>
				<h4>Mission</h4>
				<p>Our primary mission is to help prepare one another for the successful transfer to a 4year University to complete an Engineering degree with a realistic outlook on the various engineering fields. The club also provides a bridge between students, faculty, and professionals, providing the sort of help and guidance not available from general study areas like the MLC.</p>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>The North Seattle CC Engineering Club is a student organization for those interested in all the different fields of engineering. This includes mechanical, civil, electrical, environmental, aviation, and many more.</p>
